    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date: February 13, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <span class="entity-name">HearGlobal LLC</span> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information in relation to the <strong>HearThai</strong> mobile application and our other language learning services.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We believe in "Privacy by Design." We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. HearThai does not require account registration or the creation of a user profile to access its features.</p>

    <h2>2. App Tracking & Advertising</h2>
    <p>We do not track your activity across other companies’ apps or websites. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>
    <p>For marketing purposes, we may use Apple's SKAdNetwork for anonymous ad attribution. This process is handled by the iOS operating system and does not provide us with your identity, device ID, or any personal data.</p>

    <h2>3. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions, including subscriptions and in-app purchases, are processed securely by Apple via the App Store. <span class="entity-name">HearGlobal LLC</span> does not have access to, nor do we store, your credit card information, billing address, or other sensitive financial details.</p>

    <h2>4. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your learning progress, quiz scores, and settings are stored locally on your device. This data remains under your control. Please note that if you delete the app, this local data may be removed unless it has been backed up via your device's standard iCloud backup system.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>As we expand our services (including future "Hear" series applications), we may update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
